## Hi there üëã

Currently I'm active as a consultant for HeadFWD. At this very moment I'm working at Brunel, creating a new dashboard environment for new comers. In this dashboard they'll find all the information they need, all their tasks and communication with their manager.

### üõ†Ô∏è Stack

This is the stack I'm most comfortable with but I'm always open to try new things. Always wanted to try SolidJS and want to explore more back-end languages that are not JS.

- React 
- Typescript
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- RadixUI
- StitchesJS
- GraphQL
- ExpressJS

### üíº Side project

On the side I'm working on a fitnessapplication. This is build with Typescript, NextJS, StitchesJS and RadixUI. Once I have the time I'll create a GH board for it to keep track of future features and or bugs
