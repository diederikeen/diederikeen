## Hi there 👋

Currently I'm active as a consultant for HeadFWD. At this very moment I'm working at Brunel, creating a new dashboard environment for new comers. In this dashboard they'll find all the information they need, all their tasks and communication with their manager.

### 🛠️ Stack

This is the stack I'm most comfortable with but I'm always open to try new things. Always wanted to try SolidJS and want to explore more back-end languages that are not JS.

- React 
- Typescript
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- RadixUI
- StitchesJS
- GraphQL
- ExpressJS
